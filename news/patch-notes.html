<h1>MHServerEmu 0.6.0 Patch Notes</h1>

<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Implemented avatar and team-up unlocks.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Automatic unlocks can be toggled by changing the AutoUnlockAvatars and AutoUnlockTeamUps settings in Config.ini.</li>
		<li>Automatic unlocks are on by default for testing. This will be changed in version 1.0.0.</li>
		<li>Team-ups now unlock after you finish the tutorial, same as avatars.</li>
		<li>Added a new !unlock hero command, which can be used to unlock “removed” heroes (Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer).</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Implemented avatar and team-up synergies.</li>
    <li>Implemented prestige.</li>
    <li>Implemented avatar-specific swap validation. This fixes the exploit that allowed you to swap to heroes that do not pass the restrictions for the current region and/or difficulty.</li>
    <li>Added a new PlayerCountDivisor setting to Config.ini, which can be used to set the target number of players per game instance.</li>
    <li>Implemented Prototype Patch Manager, which can be used to apply server-side changes to game data at runtime.</li>
    <li>Ping calculations now take server-side processing delay into account. This results in ping values being higher in general, which is more representative of the actual latency.</li>
    <li>Overhauled the Frontend service.</li>
	<ul>
        <li>Improved performance of network message handling.</li>
        <li>Improved overall reliability.</li>
        <li>Players will no longer get frequently disconnected on unreliable connections (e.g. when playing over Wi-Fi).</li>
	</ul>
    <li>Overhauled the command system.</li>
	<ul>
        <li>Implemented command documentation generator. Documentation for the current set of commands can be generated by using the new !generatecommanddocs.</li>
        <li>Command invocations are now logged.</li>
	</ul>
    <li>Added !maxomega and !resetomega admin commands.</li>
    <li>Continued to incrementally improve optimization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Implemented leaderboards.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Leaderboards can be enabled by changing the value of the LeaderboardsEnabled setting in Config.ini to true.</li>
        <li>By default only the three permanent leaderboards (Achievement Points, Prestige Progression, and Progression Summary) are enabled.</li>
        <li>Time-limited leaderboards can be enabled by modifying the LeaderboardSchedule.json file located in Data\Leaderboards. Schedule changes can be applied by using the new !leaderboards reloadschedule command or by restarting the server.</li>
		<ul>
            <li>IsEnabled turns the leaderboard on or off.</li>
            <li>StartTime specifies the reference time in the UTC+0 time zone used for calculating leaderboard resets.</li>
            <li>MaxResetCount specifies how many times leaderboards can reset. The default value of 0 means that the leaderboard can reset indefinitely. The number of resets is calculated relative to StartTime.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Implemented the Nearby tab of the Social panel.</li>
    <li>The Say and Emote chat channels are now limited to players in proximity.</li>
    <li>The Local chat channel is now limited to players in the current region.</li>
    <li>Chat player reports are now logged.</li>

	</ul>

    <li>Implemented talents.</li>
    <li>Added a new AllowSameGroupTalents setting to Config.ini, which can be used to allow talents in the same row to be active at the same time.</li>
    <li>Implemented Rogue’s Stolen Powers.</li>
    <li>Added new admin commands for managing Stolen Powers:</li>
	<ul>
        <li>!power stealpowers – unlocks all stealable powers.</li>
        <li>!power stealavatarpowers – unlocks powers that can be stolen from other playable heroes.</li>
        <li>!power forgetstolenpowers – removes all stolen power unlocks.</li>
	</ul>
    <li>Implemented transform powers.</li>
    <li>Implemented secondary resource overrides.</li>

    <li>Implemented persistent cooldowns.</li>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue with the loot vacuum power that caused it to grant more credits than it is supposed to.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue that prevented non-avatar entities from spawning loot through power events (e.g. Extra Healing Orbs affix in Danger Room scenarios).</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with avatar live tuning for the client not referencing the correct prototypes.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with how negative integer and time property values are replicated to the client.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue with AI-controlled agents not using the correct cooldown values when their powers are interrupted.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue that made players get stuck in the throwing state when picking up throwable objects in hub regions (e.g. chairs in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Recon Post in Chapter 3).</li>
	<li>Fixed avatar primary resource not resetting on resurrection.</li>
	<li>Fixed cheat death procs not preventing death.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue that prevented non-physical sources of unmodifiable damage over time from applying.</li>
	<li>Fixed bounds of AI-controlled world entities becoming corrupted after using a power. This fixes various desync issues, especially with enemies that move by teleporting (e.g. M.O.D.O.K.).</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue that caused AIAggroRange override properties to not be taken into account.</li>
	<li>Added a workaround for an issue where controlling a mission target entity prevented mission completion.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue that made the Hunting Grounds waypoint in Chapter 6 unusable.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the lifespan of entities created by summon powers from being modified by power duration bonuses on the summoner entity.</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where enemies tagged by multiple powers from the same player were tracking only the last tagging power, preventing some achievements from being completeable.</li>
	<li>Fixed weekly commendation limit not resetting if a player fully capped their commendations in a previous week.</li>
	<li>Fixed DamageMagnitude property not being taken into account in damage calculations (e.g. She-Hulk’s finishers, Muspelheim boss powers).</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue where elite enemies would get stuck in a “zombie” state when they became unsimulated at low health.</li>
