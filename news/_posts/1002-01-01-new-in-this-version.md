## New In Version 0.2.0

* Implemented multiplayer: you can now see other players logged into the same server in-game and interact with them.

* Hero swapping now happens in-game with no loading screens.

* Implemented the inventory system: you can pick up and drop items to the ground, stack them, equip and unequip them, see items equipped on nearby heroes.

* Enemies now drop loot. Currently the loot system uses a placeholder loot table for all enemies, and there is no affix generation.

* Implemented the navi system: the server now has a representation of the world geometry used for collision detection.

* Implemented physics and locomotion systems, which makes it possible to synchronize world entity movement between clients.
