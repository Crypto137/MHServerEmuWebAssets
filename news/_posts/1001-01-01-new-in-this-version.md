## New In Version 0.5.0

* Most powers are now fully functional.

* Primary and secondary resources now work.

* Damage calculations have undergone a significant pass, resulting in most stats now working and higher difficulty tiers being actually difficult.

* Achievements are now earnable.

* The Infinity system is now working.

* Gs are now spendable. You can earn more Gs by converting Eternity Splinters using the new `!store convertes` command.
