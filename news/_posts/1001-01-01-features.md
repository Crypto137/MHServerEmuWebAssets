## Features

* You can play as any hero and use most of their powers.

* You can change your costume by "buying" it in the <a onclick="myApi.OpenCatalogToItem('CostumesPage', '')">in-game store</a>.

* Currently there is no character progression. Only your costume selections and action bar powers are saved between sessions.

* You can explore the entire game, and all regions are randomly generated. Regions refresh periodically as long as there are no players in them.

* You can encounter enemies and deal damage to them, but most combat mechanics are not yet implemented.

* You cannot see other players in-game. However, you can chat with them as long as all of you are connected to the same server.
