## Welcome to MHServerEmu 0.4.0!

Welcome to the fourth official release of MHServerEmu! In this update we have implemented the mission system, allowing you to play through the story from beginning to end. The loot system has also received a big update, which includes additional drop types and item affixes.

In this panel you will find an overview of what you can check out in this version of MHServerEmu.

Use the navigation buttons in the bottom right corner to browse. You can open this panel again at any time by pressing the news button [N].
