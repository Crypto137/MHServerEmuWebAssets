## Known Issues

* Powers that rely on buffs / debuffs (conditions), spawned areas (hotspots), summons, and other complex mechanics will not function correctly until those systems are implemented.

* Resources (spirit, anger, power cosmic, etc.) are not yet implemented.

* Talents, traits, and passives are not yet implemented.

* Items currently do not have affixes, but your hero's baseline stats are buffed to compensate for this.

* Dynamic combat level (level scaling) is currently not implemented, so all combat calculations are based on level 60.

* Assist and passive modes for team-ups are not yet implemented.

* Hero synergies can be selected, but they do not affect your stats.
